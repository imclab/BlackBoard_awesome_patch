After years of endless BlackBoard patch releases, we had an idea:
what if we released a single patch that fixed _everything_ that's wrong with 
BlackBoard? Ladies and gentlemen, **this is that patch.** And for the first time,
it's open source!

No more lock-in to a single vendor. No more lousy support. No more lawsuits.
No more excruciating UX and mangled legacy code. No more walls-around-teaching
mentality. This. Fixes. Everything.

Enjoy.
